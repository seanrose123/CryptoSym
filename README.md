# CryptoSym - A Cryptocurrency Trading Simulator

## Project Proposal

CryptoSym is a website that aims to provide a safe environment for people to practice trading cryptocurrencies on an exchange in real-time. Users can begin by trading with any amount of money, ranging from $1 to $100,000. This website is aimed to be a learning tool for people who are unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency markets and want to practice with fake money. CryptoSym will offer an initial tutorial on the real-world process of transferring money from your bank account to the exchange, creating a risk-free and informative environment for the user.

## Why This Idea Rocks

CryptoSym seeks to make investing in the cryptocurrency world easy to do with an engaging learning platform. There are very appealing opportunities in the coin markets, huge returns on investment changes to the tech world, and disrupts on how companies traditionally get funded. For our group, in particular, we all have experience with investing in the coin markets and know the in’s and out’s, as well as the difficulty of first starting out. There is currently no other platform that does this, and we see it as a great opportunity to create something we know of and are interested in, using the tools we have learned from our time at LMU.
